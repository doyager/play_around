# fair and capacity schedulers

Fair scheduling is a method of assigning resources to jobs such that all jobs get, on average, an equal share of
resources over time. When there is a single job running, that job uses the entire cluster. When other jobs are 
submitted, tasks slots that free up are assigned to the new jobs, so that each job gets roughly the same amount of CPU time. Unlike the default Hadoop scheduler, which forms a queue of jobs, this lets short jobs finish in reasonable time while not starving long jobs. It is also a reasonable way to share a cluster between a number of users. Finally, fair sharing can also work with job priorities - the priorities are used as weights to determine the fraction of total compute time that each job should get.

The CapacityScheduler is designed to allow sharing a large cluster while giving each organization a minimum 
capacity guarantee. The central idea is that the available resources in the Hadoop Map-Reduce cluster are partitioned 
among multiple organizations who collectively fund the cluster based on computing needs. There is an added benefit that
an organization can access any excess capacity no being used by others. This provides elasticity for the organizations 
in a cost-effective manner.
