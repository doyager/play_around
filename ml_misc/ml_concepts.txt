#precision
#recall
#Fscore


First, let’s just look at precision, recall, and the score.

Precision, which we’ll denote p for convenience, is defined as

𝑝=𝑡𝑝 / 𝑡𝑝+𝑓𝑝

where tp and fp are true positives and false positives respectively.

Recall, which we’ll denote as r, is defined as

𝑟=𝑡𝑝/ 𝑡𝑝+𝑓𝑛

where fn stands for false negatives.

So precision is the ratio of true positives to those predicted positive, while recall is the ratio of true positives to all positives.

The 𝐹1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of p and r:

𝐹1=2 * 𝑝𝑟 /[𝑝+𝑟] =⋯=2𝑡𝑝 / [2𝑡𝑝+𝑓𝑝+𝑓𝑛]

which, on the surface, seems like a really strange thing to look at.

So, why do we look at it?

Well, obviously the precision and recall are important. But why the harmonic mean instead of the arithmetic and geometric.

Well, arithmetic is best when we have things that it makes sense to sum. We tend to think in terms of this most often. I don’t think I need to give an example here.

Geometric is best when we are multiplying… like, for example, calculating the true interest rate over time.

And harmonic is best when we’re dealing with rates and ratios. Since precision and recall are ratios (side note: all rates are technically ratios, but let’s not get into mathematical semantics), it’s the most appropriate.

Of course, the 𝐹1 score weights precision and recall equally, something that’s not always deemed a good thing (see the Wikipedia page in the question link, and, for example, a document it refers to: http://www.flinders.edu.au/scien...).
