######### MVC

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.

Model–view–controller is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user

Model
The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic-related data. For example, a Customer object will retrieve the customer information from the database, manipulate it and update it data back to the database or use it to render data.

View
The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. For example, the Customer view will include all the UI components such as text boxes, dropdowns, etc. that the final user interacts with.

Controller
Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output. For example, the Customer controller will handle all the interactions and inputs from the Customer View and update the database using the Customer Model. The same controller will be used to view the Customer data.

#Advantages & disadvantages

Advantages:

Simultaneous development – Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views.
High cohesion – MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. The views for a specific model are also grouped together.
Loose coupling – The very nature of the MVC framework is such that there is low coupling among models, views or controllers
Ease of modification – Because of the separation of responsibilities, future development or modification is easier
Multiple views for a model – Models can have multiple views

# Disadvantages:

The disadvantages of MVC can be generally categorized as overhead for incorrectly factored software.

Code navigability – The framework navigation can be complex because it introduces new layers of indirection and requires users to adapt to the decomposition criteria of MVC.
Multi-artifact consistency – Decomposing a feature into three artifacts causes scattering. Thus, requiring developers to maintain the consistency of multiple representations at once.
Undermined by inevitable clustering – Applications tend to have heavy interaction between what the user sees and what the user uses. Therefore each feature's computation and state tends to get clustered into one of the 3 program parts, erasing the purported advantages of MVC.
Excessive boilerplate – Due to the application computation and state being typically clustered into one of the 3 parts, the other parts degenerate into either boilerplate shims or code-behind[16] that exists only to satisfy the MVC pattern.
Pronounced learning curve – Knowledge on multiple technologies becomes the norm. Developers using MVC need to be skilled in multiple technologies.
Lack of incremental benefit – UI applications are already factored into components, and achieving code reuse and independence via the component architecture, leaving no incremental benefit to MVC.



########  ASP.NET MVC
ASP.NET supports three major development models: Web Pages, Web Forms and MVC (Model View Controller). ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable presentation framework that is integrated with the existing ASP.NET features, such as master pages, authentication, etc. Within .NET, this framework is defined in the System.Web.Mvc assembly. The latest version of the MVC Framework is 5.0. We use Visual Studio to create ASP.NET MVC applications which can be added as a template in Visual Studio.

ASP.NET MVC Features
ASP.NET MVC provides the following features −

Ideal for developing complex but lightweight applications.

Provides an extensible and pluggable framework, which can be easily replaced and customized. For example, if you do not wish to use the in-built Razor or ASPX View Engine, then you can use any other third-party view engines or even customize the existing ones.

Utilizes the component-based design of the application by logically dividing it into Model, View, and Controller components. This enables the developers to manage the complexity of large-scale projects and work on individual components.

MVC structure enhances the test-driven development and testability of the application, since all the components can be designed interface-based and tested using mock objects. Hence, ASP.NET MVC Framework is ideal for projects with large team of web developers.

Supports all the existing vast ASP.NET functionalities, such as Authorization and Authentication, Master Pages, Data Binding, User Controls, Memberships, ASP.NET Routing, etc.

Does not use the concept of View State (which is present in ASP.NET). This helps in building applications, which are lightweight and gives full control to the developers.

Thus, you can consider MVC Framework as a major framework built on top of ASP.NET providing a large set of added functionality focusing on component-based development and testing.


########What is Micro Service?
Micro Service is an architecture that allows the developers to develop and deploy services independently.
Each service running has its own process and this achieves the lightweight model to support business applications.

Advantages
Micro services offers the following advantages to its developers −

Easy deployment
Simple scalability
Compatible with Containers
Minimum configuration
Lesser production time


##### Spring 

Spring is an enterprise Java framework. It was designed to simplify Java EE development and make developers more productive. Spring makes use of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection to promote good software coding practices and speed up development time.

#### spring mvc

The Spring Web MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications. The MVC pattern results in separating the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

The Model encapsulates the application data and in general they will consist of POJO.

The View is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret.

The Controller is responsible for processing user requests and building an appropriate model and passes it to the view for rendering.

#The DispatcherServlet:

The Spring Web model-view-controller (MVC) framework is designed around a DispatcherServlet that handles all the HTTP requests and responses. The request processing workflow of the Spring Web MVC DispatcherServlet is illustrated in the following diagram −

Spring DispatcherServlet
Following is the sequence of events corresponding to an incoming HTTP request to DispatcherServlet −

After receiving an HTTP request, DispatcherServlet consults the HandlerMapping to call the appropriate Controller.

The Controller takes the request and calls the appropriate service methods based on used GET or POST method. The service method will set model data based on defined business logic and returns view name to the DispatcherServlet.

The DispatcherServlet will take help from ViewResolver to pickup the defined view for the request.

Once view is finalized, The DispatcherServlet passes the model data to the view which is finally rendered on the browser.

All the above-mentioned components, i.e. HandlerMapping, Controller, and ViewResolver are parts of WebApplicationContext w which is an extension of the plainApplicationContext with some extra features necessary for web applications.

# Required Configuration  : web.xml under WEBContent/WEB-INF
You need to map requests that you want the DispatcherServlet to handle, by using a URL mapping in the web.xml file. The following is an example to show declaration and mapping for HelloWeb DispatcherServlet example −

<web-app id = "WebApp_ID" version = "2.4"
   xmlns = "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" 
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee 
   http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">
    
   <display-name>Spring MVC Application</display-name>
   
   <servlet>
      <servlet-name>HelloWeb</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>
         org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
      </servlet-class>
      <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
   </servlet>

   <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>HelloWeb</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
The web.xml file will be kept in the WebContent/WEB-INF directory of your web application. Upon initialization of HelloWeb DispatcherServlet, the framework will try to load the application context from a file named [servlet-name]-servlet.xml located in the application's WebContent/WEB-INFdirectory. In this case, our file will be HelloWebservlet.xml.



#####spring boot :

Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service. It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications. This chapter will give you an introduction to Spring Boot and familiarizes you with its basic concepts.


What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application that you can just run. You can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

Advantages
Spring Boot offers the following advantages to its developers −

Easy to understand and develop spring applications
Increases productivity
Reduces the development time
Goals
Spring Boot is designed with the following goals −

To avoid complex XML configuration in Spring
To develop a production ready Spring applications in an easier way
To reduce the development time and run the application independently
Offer an easier way of getting started with the application
Why Spring Boot?
You can choose Spring Boot because of the features and benefits it offers as given here −

It provides a flexible way to configure Java Beans, XML configurations, and Database Transactions.

It provides a powerful batch processing and manages REST endpoints.

In Spring Boot, everything is auto configured; no manual configurations are needed.

It offers annotation-based spring application

Eases dependency management

It includes Embedded Servlet Container

How does it work?
Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project by using @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation. For example, if MySQL database is on your classpath, but you have not configured any database connection, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database.

The entry point of the spring boot application is the class contains @SpringBootApplication annotation and the main method.

Spring Boot automatically scans all the components included in the project by using @ComponentScan annotation.

Spring Boot Starters
Handling dependency management is a difficult task for big projects. Spring Boot resolves this problem by providing a set of dependencies for developers convenience.

For example, if you want to use Spring and JPA for database access, it is sufficient if you include spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in your project.

Note that all Spring Boot starters follow the same naming pattern spring-boot-starter- *, where * indicates that it is a type of the application.
