Scala IDE :


      Error 1:

      ENTRY org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt 4 2 2017-07-10 14:34:58.379
      !MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: "org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt".
      !STACK 0
      java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed

      Fix:

      Deleting file workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.e4.workbench/workbench.xmi seems to work well without side effects.
