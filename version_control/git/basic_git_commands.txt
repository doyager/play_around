#list branch
git branch -a 

#switch branch
git checkout <branch-name>
use git branch , to verify star beside your current branch

#push from detached head 
git push origin HEAD:name-of-your-branch

Eg :
user1@machine :$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at origin/feature/branch1)

git push origin HEAD:feature/branch1

or
git branch new-branch-name
git checkout new-branch-name
git push -u origin new-branch-name

# rename folder 

Basic rename (or move):

git mv <old name> <new name>
Case sensitive rename—eg. from casesensitive to CaseSensitive—you must use a two step:

git mv casesensitive tmp
git mv tmp CaseSensitive

# git rename branch

          

          #Start by switching to the local branch which you want to rename:

          git checkout <old_name>
          
          
          #Rename the local branch by typing:

          git branch -m <new_name>
          
          
          #If you’ve already pushed the <old_name> branch to the remote repository delete the <old_name> remote branch:

          git push origin --delete <old_name>
          
          #Finally, push the <new_name> local branch and reset the upstream branch

          git push origin -u <new_name>
  
  
# delete file :
          # git rm , deletes from both GIT and FS

          git rm file1.txt
          git commit -m "remove file1.txt"
          git push origin branch_name 


          # only from Git and NOT from File system 
          git rm --cached file1.txt
          git commit -m "remove file1.txt"
          git push origin branch_name  

# delete folder :

                    git rm -r folder-name
            #Commit the change:
                    git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
            #Push the change to your remote repository:
                    git push origin master
          


     #Discard all local changes, but save them for possible re-use later
     
     git stash


     # undo changes to a file on local file system: [ Changes will be permanently removed]
     
          git checkout -- <file-name>
          
          

     #Discard all local changes to all files permanently

          git reset --hard


#create branch locally and push to remote server

git checkout -b <new_feature_branch_name> #creates new branch
git push -u origin new_feature_branch_name #to push to server

eg:  git checkout -b agent-enhancments-301
     git push -u origin agent-enhancments-301


#create branch locally
git branch <branch-name>
eg: git branch test-story


#delete branch locally
git branch -d <branhc-name>
eg: git branch -d test-story



#Basic Snapshotting

        #Check status

        git status	

        #Add a file to the staging area
        git add [file-name.txt]	

        #Add all new and changed files to the staging area
        git add -A	

        #Commit changes
        git commit -m "[commit message]"	

        #Remove a file (or folder)
        git rm -r [file-name.txt]
